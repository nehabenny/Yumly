### Project Description
Yumly instantly crafts delicious, well-formatted recipes based on the ingredients you have and your dietary preferences. Whether you‚Äôre diabetic, watching cholesterol, or just out of groceries, we‚Äôve got your back. No more kitchen panic, no more lifeless diet food‚Äîjust instant, AI-generated culinary inspiration!
### The Problem statement
Ever wasted hours scrolling through endless recipe blogs only to find a 5,000-word life story before the actual recipe? Or worse‚Äîstarted cooking, only to realize you‚Äôre missing a key ingredient? We‚Äôre here to end the madness! And for those with dietary restrictions, why should you suffer through generic, uninspired meals? No more boring ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù food‚Äîour AI serves up delicious, tailored recipes that match your needs!
### The Solution
We‚Äôve trained an AI to think like a Michelin-starred chef (minus the attitude). Just type your ingredients, choose a dietary preference (Diabetic-friendly? Low cholesterol? No problem!), and voil√†! Instant recipes without the fluff‚Äîno life stories, no irrelevant childhood memories, just food tailored to your needs.
